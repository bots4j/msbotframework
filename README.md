Contributing
------------
We welcome bug fixes and new features in the form of pull requests. If you'd like to contribute, please be mindful of the
following guidelines:
* All changes should include suitable tests, whether to demonstrate the bug or exercise and document the new feature.
* Please make one change per pull request.
* If the new feature is significantly large/complex/breaks existing behaviour, please first post a summary of your idea
on the mailing list to generate a discussion. This will avoid significant amounts of coding time spent on changes that ultimately get rejected.
* Try to avoid reformats of files that change the indentation, tabs to spaces etc., as this makes reviewing diffs much
more difficult.
